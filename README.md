# LoRa sketches for different hardware solutions

## M5Stack with LoRa node
This sample project is based on the official LoRa M5Stack lib but personally I'm not satisfied with that.
I found a better sorution with LMIC mechanism and I built a complex project around it, for details please

## RAK811 WisNode arduino shield
A very basic sketch that tests the Join/Uplink/Downlink functionalities.
